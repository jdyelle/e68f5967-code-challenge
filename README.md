# Coding Challenge
## Thank you
I left a number of comments, especially where there were philosophical discussions to be
had.  If you open the Visual Studio task list (or another TODO plugin in VSCode) you'll see the 
evolution of the project tagged in the comments.  I probably should have made them as separate
git commits to make things easier to read, but I just unzipped the file and started working 
without a `git init` and I didn't want to wind everything back to redo it.

There were a few places I added some extra stuff (like the ability to chronologically list 
compensation changes) but I didn't add endpoints for those, just illustrated capacity.  I'd 
expect in a production app those would be trimmed out after discussion.  I also provided a few
ways to access the compensation endpoints, again expecting a discussion and a resolution for 
which one was the appropriate approach.

Thanks for reading.
